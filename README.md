<h2>Based on old Richards tape via BCPL for C64 on Sourceforge</h2>

Converted from https://sourceforge.net/projects/bcpl-c64/ with Github Copilot/Gemini 3 Pro

Vanilla html/javascript. Serve statically from root.

Currently running at:

https://dagfinndybvig.github.io/onlineBCPL/

Can be used with the clasic book:

Note: This is an old dialect of the language. I have created options in the UI to convert to uppercase/old style brackets during upload to accomodate the newer style of BCPL. However, other fixes may or may not be needed to make newer programs run. 

All hail Martin Richards, creator of BCPL!
