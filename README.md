<h2>Based on old Richards tape via BCPL for C64 on Sourceforge</h2>

Converted from https://sourceforge.net/projects/bcpl-c64/ with Github Copilot/Gemini 3 Pro

Vanilla html/javascript. Serve statically from root.

Currently running at:

https://dagfinndybvig.github.io/onlineBCPL/

Can be used with the clasic book:

Note: This is an old dialect of the language. I have created options in the UI to convert to uppercase/old style brackets during upload to accomodate the newer style of BCPL. However, other fixes may or may not be needed to make newer programs run.<br>
To get a feel for the old syntax I recommend taking a look at the file cmpltest.b in the examples, which actually runs in the present system. 

All hail Martin Richards, creator of BCPL!
